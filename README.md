## About Application
Project is Cinema Management. The main feature is ordering seat feature with realtime. And System structure of its is micro-service( all services refer to one database). My team use Java just for API. And will use Nodejs for runtime.

### Tech used

### Ordering seat realtime feature
Most Applications's ordering seat is just a normal API, if two or more users at the same time request to order just same seat, if the person whose condition good than, they will have that seat, otherwise that person will be in the queue constantly.
And myteam's solution is: if a person who pick before, that this seat will lock preventing to other request that want to pick it. if fail, just rollback, and the seat will be available.
### Flow of Payment API's activities
- If user want to navigate to payment, Backend will create and return the URL payment for Client(by the way, this url is the limited time url, and if this's expire, these seats was picked will be unlocked)
- If everything is sucessful, Backend will return the callback url (this url including useful params for showing state of this user's payment). By the way in backend will access to "IPN" API for getting information of this payment and then handling that.
